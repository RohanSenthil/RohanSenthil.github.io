Heres the code for my portfolio/website
Theres a lot of extra code especially in the CSS/SCSS because i copied and pasted the css/scss and just edit changes for the different pages

On Mobile there might be a small white space/column depending on your phone dimensions and the "Cybersecurity Enthusiast" might not be centered. If anyone knows how to fix it you can dm me

Hope the experience was good!

Thanks for reading!
