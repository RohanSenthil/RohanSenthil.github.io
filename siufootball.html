            As part of my schools Web Development Module Project, I decide to create a website that provides real-time updates on football results and statistics. <br>
            <br>
            Though the module only covered vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I decided to build my website using Angular, a JavaScript framework I had learnt during my time as a Web Development Intern during the O'level break to streamline the development process.
            <br><br>
            To get the real-time data, I had to use an API, I opted for the free API <span class="links">football-data.org</span>.
            <br><br>
            Overall, I had a lot of fun with this project especially in the UI and Logo Design (which I am very proud of). Challenges I faced was sorting the data accordingly, implementing a date filter and figuring out when to archive the current seasons data. However, I was able to overcome these challenges.
