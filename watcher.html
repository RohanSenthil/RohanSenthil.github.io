            This project was part of my final project for Harvard's CS50x course, however it was also something I had always wanted to try out.
            <br><br>
            The Watcher is a discord chat moderation bot with it main features being an phishing link detector. I felt this was a good idea as I had witnessed a lot of my friends on discord getting hacked because of phishing links such as fake free discord nitro links.
            <br><br>
            Programming a discord bot was something I had never done before so I had to do a lot of research and independently learning.
            <br><br>
            The discord bot was built in TypeScript using a phishing link database API, a discord bot node package and MongoDB as the backend.
